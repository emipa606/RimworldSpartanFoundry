  <description>Rimworld: Spartan Foundry is a vanilla power armor expansion adding 9 new sets of advanced, end-game power armor. A set of Powered Assault Armor is craftable in very late game, requiring Ship Computer Core technology and an AI Persona Core. The other 8 sets of armour are NOT craftable and can only be obtained from quests and raids. The armor sets contain advanced glitterworld overshield technology, capable of absorbing several shots before requiring a long time to regenerate. Each armor set provides different bonuses and elements can be combined to suit every rimworld colonist.
